Network Protocols

There are three protocols used by ciruela:

1. HTTP just to show you some status pages
2. A protocol to send file data on top of websockets
3. A gossip protocol on top of UDP

In future we will probably expose some JSON API over HTTP just to allow easier
interoperability with the daemon.
